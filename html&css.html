                            Explore and master the main Gestalt visual design principles and practice to work with vector-based graphics in Illustrator.<br><br>
                        Brief<br><br>
    
                        Your task is to recreate the nine Gestalt principles you learned about in today's lesson in small illustrations. 
                        The principles are figure/ground, proximity, common fate, continuation, similarity, pragnanz, closure, symmetry, and regularity. 
                        Try to come up with new ideas and ways on how to visualize these principles. 
                        You should focus on form and use just black or gray colors. Do not use any other colors and keep it simple!</p>

                            Practice to work with vector based graphics and create a simple icon set that translates complex information into easy accessible visual language. Learn to create and optimize vector graphics for use on screen-based devices.<br><br>
                        Brief<br><br>
    
                        Icons are an essential part of user interfaces and helps to visually express actions and messages. 
                        Your task is to create a collection of 6 icons for the webpage of a small local sushi restaurant. 
                        You can choose the design, color and mood for the icons but remember that all the 6 icons will be used on the same webpage and should have the same visual style and language. 
                        Icons should work well in any size so be cautious when using very small details in the icon design.</p>

                    <p>Goal<br><br>

                            Understanding and implementation of CSS pseudo classes; understanding of the
                            differences between inline and block elements; use of < div> and < span>
                                            elements; Use of {class} and {id} descriptors.<br><br>
                                            Brief<br><br>

                                            Add interactivity with the use of CSS pseudo classes, and add
                                            inline and block CSS styling.
                                            Pseudo classes are used to reflect the state of an element. For
                                            example, a change of state for an < a> element would be when a
                                                    user mouses over it, or clicks on it. The effect of this
                                                    will be to change the appearance of the element. While
                                                    there are several types of pseudo classes, we will be
                                                    looking at pseudo classes specifically for < a>
                                                            elements.
                                                            So far we have been using CSS selectors for
                                                            existing HTML elements. There are circumstances,
                                                            however, where it is useful to create custom
                                                            selectors for specific elements.
                                                            ID selectors are used to define unique items on
                                                            a page. Class selectors are used to define
                                                            multiple items on a page. </p>

                            To increase familiarity with CSS, and an understanding of the importance of

                            Brief<br><br>

                            Use Cascading Style Sheets to stylise 4 HTML web pages; use inline, internal,
                            and external styles and identify the advantages and disadvantages of each
                            approach.
                            CSS allows us to meaningfully change the appearance of our HTML. Our aim is to
                            keep the content and appearance as separate as possible. This approach has a
                            number of advantages: it allows us to change the "look" of HTML content without
                            having to change the content; it also allows for HTML text to be read by
                            machines, and is generally considered best practice. </p>

                    <p>Goal<br><br>

                            In this activity we are going to focus on the proper usage of tables, as well as
                            how they may be styled using CSS. Tables are intended for the organization and
                            display of data, but this does not mean they cannot be styled with CSS, just as
                            any other HTML element. Styling may aid readability and comprehension of tabular
                            data, as well as making it more aesthetically pleasing. We will have a brief but
                            by no means exhaustive look at styling HTML tables. <br><br>
                            Brief<br><br>

                            To learn and practice how to document your work process and write a project
                            report.<br><br>
                            Brief<br><br>

                            Documenting your work process can be a challenging exercise and writing a
                            technical report is not the easiest task. Having some good routines and a clear
                            idea on how to document and write your reports makes it easier. Of course, not
                            all the projects will require documentation and report writing. But there will
                            be some projects of a bigger scale as, for example, semester assignment where
                            you will be enforced to write a report.</p>
