                            Build an HTML website for a company called 'Re-cycle' that offer eco-friendly, guided
                            cycling tours
                            of a town. Because their clients are travelling, it is very important that the website is
                            mobile
                            responsive.
                            It should have 4 pages: home page, about us, contact us, and the list of routes/tours. Do
                            not use
                            Bootstrap or another similar framework - we want to see your ability to create responsive
                            layouts

                                        Build a UNICEF Mother's Day marketing campaign website.<br>
                                        The main purpose of this website is to highlight the four mothers day products
                                        on sale and
                                        to ensure users click to an external e-commerce website where the user will be
                                        able to buy the
                                        products (link to e-commerce website will be provided).
                                        The website should have a: <br><br>
                                        Homepage<br><br>
                                        The Homepage should showcase all the products in a way that entices users to buy
                                        the product.
                                        Each product should have a photo of product and a clear call to action to buy
                                        the product, onClick
                                        it should take the user to the product detail page.<br><br>
                                        Product detail page for each product.<br><br>
                                        The product detail page should have a product description and photograph and
                                        link to the external
                                        e-commerce website
                                        The website must have a design that appeals to the target audience and is
                                        accordance with the brand
                                        guidelines.
                                        Compositional principles, typography, and color schemes must be
                                        considered.<br><br>
                                        A project work plan, including a Gantt chart, should be included.<br><br>
                                        Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
                                        The site should use external CSS style sheets.
                                        The site should download quickly, and not be overly "heavy". Images should not
                                        be over 200kb.
                                        The site should take WCAG principles into consideration, especially regarding
                                        hierarchy, navigation,
                                        and color usage.
                                        The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on a variety of
                                        devices.
                                        The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your
                                        use of meta tags and
                                        alt text).
                                        A report, documenting the entire project, must be included with the project
                                        delivery. Ensure the
                                        report is a PDF and follows the correct naming conventions.
                                        Pencil sketches, mood boards, and resources must be included in the report.
                                    </p>
